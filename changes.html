Since we ran out of time, we were unable to create our own product images or product descriptions.
Therefore, we used the site sokoglam.com for product descriptions and this website: https://blog.justfab.com/2016/02/korean-skin-care-anti-aging-routine-for-flawless-skin/ 
for our product image.

We also decided not to place the security badges in the footer, as we felt this would make the footer feel cluttered.
If our site was a fully functioning online store, we would display the badges during the check out process instead as this
information would be more relevant to them at that time.
